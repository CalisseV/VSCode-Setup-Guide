# Visual Studio Code and GitHub - Setup Guide
Visual Studio Code and GitHub setup guide for K18 Lab and CC Workshop speakers.

## Overview
K18 Marks a big change in how we deploy lab guides to our attendees as we move from a printed word document to an electronic and online guide, powered by the MarkDown syntax.

The objectives of this guide is to help our speakers properly configure the Visual Studio and GitHUB tools that are required to create and publish guides. 

Please pay special attention to the notes and tips provided. 

For additional setup assisttance, please send your help requests to [#####@servicenow.com](mailto:gerald.beaulieu@servicenow.com). 

Topics Covered in this Guide: 
* Topic 1 – GitHub Account
* Topic 2 – Confgure GitHub locally
* Topic 3 – Install Visual Studio Code
* Topic 4 – Accept GitHub org Invitation
* Topic 5 – Accept Guide Invitation
* Topic 6 – Access Guide from Visual Studio
* Topic 7 – Save and Publish Changes


Use Heading 1/H1 _only_ for lab titles.  All content under H1 will render as a single page when digital guidebooks are published.

# GitHub Account
## Create and Share Account
Follow these steps to create and share your GitHub acccount:

1. If you don't have a GitHub account already, navigate to .  [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) to create an account. The email address you submit shoudl be your ServiceNow email address. The user name can be whatever you wish.
1. Send the user name defined in step 1 to [Jason McKee](mailto:jason.mckee@servicenow.com) Jason will submit your name to the GitHub org created for K18. An inviation will be sent to your email that you must accept.

Beyond standard Markdown, we have a few conventions you need to follow for your guidebook to render properly

## H1 & H2 relationship
Always follow your H1 lab title immediately with an H2 section title.  This is a convention we're using to automatically generate the table of contents and navigation.

## Lists
While Markdown supports nesting ordered and un-ordered lists, please avoid using nested lists in your guide book.  This is to avoid conflicts with how we style (or rather, don't) nested lists on the Developer Portal.

1. Use numbered lists for task steps
1. You don't have to manually number each step

    But sometimes you need paragraphs between steps.  In those cases, indent your paragraphs with a tab.

    Multiple paragraphs are OK too.

1. And markdown will pick up numbering where you left off.
